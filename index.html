                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a first-year graduate student of math at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I have yet to choose a research advisor here. My current classes are Modern Algebra II, Number Theory II, and Complex Analysis</p>
                <p>I am always down to be contacted about interesting things. I haven't checked my personal email since, like, June, but I have been keeping up with my UTK email, listed below.</p>
                <p>I was born in Missouri and attended Webb City High School, where I graduated. Then I went to the University of Arkansas, where I graduated with undergraduate degrees in pure math and computer science. My research advisor there was Dr. Lance Edward Miller&semi; our project on investigating isogeny-torsion graphs of elliptic curves has extended to present. In my free time, I enjoy reading about modular forms and prime checking algorithms, playing Rocket League, watching Re:Zero, complaining about not having money and leaving out the Oxford comma.</p>
