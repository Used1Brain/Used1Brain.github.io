                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am an undergraduate studying pure math and computer science at the University of Arkansas. My (math) research advisor here is Dr. Lance Edward Miller&semi; we are investigating isogeny-torsion graphs of elliptic curves.</p>
                <p>My current classes are Formal Languages, Capstone II, and Complex Analysis II. My capstone project is a Godot game that teaches the player trigonometry via geometric puzzles.</p>
                <p>I am always down to be contacted about interesting things. I finally sorted my emails into folders and unsubscribed from about 100 places, so I'll be on top of responding for once.</p>
                <p>I was born in Missouri and attended Webb City High School, where I graduated. In my free time, I enjoy reading about modular forms, playing Rocket League, watching Konosuba, complaining about not having money and leaving out the Oxford comma.</p>
