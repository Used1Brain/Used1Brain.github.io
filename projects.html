                Every now and then I do a fun project such as write a song parody. Here is a list of my completed projects.
                <ul>
                    <li>A <a href="sylow-parody.pdf" target="_blank">parody of Encanto's "We Don't Talk About Bruno" titled "We Can Learn About Sylow".</a></li>
                    <li>A <a href="Greek_Math_Answer_Key.pdf" target="_blank">complicated roadmap</a> of problems for the UArk math club scavenger hunt.</li>
                </ul>
                Here is a list of my current projects.
                <ul>
                    <li>A math library for <a href="https://github.com/GanerCodes/moon">â˜¾, a programming language</a> my friend made</li>
                    <li>A smart markup language that can generate a pdf and LEAN code for a proof (with syntax highlighting and nice theorem help for vscode). Only the generation of pdf is started, since I need to become familiar with LEAN and pdf's are required for my homework.</li>
                    <li>A browser extension containing lots of theorems and definitions so I can use technology to compensate for my lack of ability to memorize things. Eventually, this will turn into a sidebar with number analyzing, as well.</li>
                    <li>A game involving a frog and some puzzles</li>
                    <li>Some chess variants that my friends and I invent</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
